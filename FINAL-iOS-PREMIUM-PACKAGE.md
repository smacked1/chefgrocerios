# ChefGrocer iOS Premium - Final UI Fixed Package

## Package Overview

- **Result**: Button now stays within screen bounds on all mobile devices

### 2. Settings White Gap Minimized
- **Issue**: Large white gaps in premium subscription tab making UI look sparse
- **Solution**: Reduced padding, spacing, and font sizes throughout settings
- **Result**: Compact, professional layout with efficient use of screen space
