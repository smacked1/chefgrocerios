# ChefGrocer - Simple Video Export Method

## üé¨ Easy App Store Video Creation

I've created a much simpler method that works on any browser without screen recording. This exports individual frames that you can easily combine into a video.

### üì± How It Works:

1. **Open** `video-generator.html` in any browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
2. **Click "Export 30 Frames"** - automatically downloads 30 PNG images
3. **Combine frames** using any video editor or online tool
4. **Set to 1 frame per second** = perfect 30-second video

### üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Tools to Combine Frames:

**Online (Free & Easy):**
- **ezgif.com** - Upload images, create video, set 1 FPS
- **canva.com** - Drag images to timeline, export as MP4

### üìã Frame Breakdown (30 frames):

**Frames 1-5:** Hero launch with ChefGrocer branding  
**Frames 6-10:** Voice cooking demonstration  
**Frames 11-15:** Recipe discovery with 500k+ database  
**Frames 16-20:** Store locator with real OpenStreetMap data  
**Frames 21-25:** Pricing plans and subscriptions
